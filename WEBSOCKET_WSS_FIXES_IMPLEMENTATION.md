# WebSocket WSS Fixes Implementation

## Overview
Implemented Claude's exact fixes for the WebSocket SSL/WSS configuration issues that were causing connection failures in production.

## Issues Fixed
1. **WebSocket SSL/WSS Configuration Issue** - Server was not properly configured for WSS (WebSocket Secure)
2. **WebSocket Connection Cycle** - Repeated disconnections and failed reconnection attempts
3. **Missing HTTPS/WSS Server** - HTTPS server was commented out, preventing WSS connections

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed server.js - Enable WSS Support
**File:** `server/server.js`
- Replaced the entire server startup section (lines ~240-290)
- Added proper port availability checking
- Enabled HTTPS server with WSS support on port 443
- Added production environment detection
- Improved error handling and logging

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// HTTPS Server with WSS support - FIXED VERSION
if (sslOptions && isProduction) {
  const httpsServer = https.createServer(sslOptions, app)
  
  // Create a second WebSocket server for WSS connections
  const wssSecure = new WebSocket.Server({ server: httpsServer })
  
  // Initialize the same WebSocket handlers for HTTPS
  createWebSocketHandlers(wssSecure, dbService, blockchainService)
  
  // Listen on port 443 for HTTPS/WSS
  httpsServer.listen(443, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log(`🔒 CryptoFlipz HTTPS Server running on port 443`)
    console.log(`🔐 WSS WebSocket server ready on wss://`)
  })
}
```

### 2. Fixed WebSocketService.js - Better Connection Handling
**File:** `src/services/WebSocketService.js`
- Increased max reconnection attempts from 5 to 10
- Added exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Implemented ping-pong keepalive mechanism (30-second intervals)
- Added better error handling and connection state management
- Improved reconnection logic with proper timer cleanup

**Key Features Added:**
- `setupPingPong()` - Sends ping every 30 seconds to keep connection alive
- Exponential backoff: `delay = Math.min(reconnectDelay * Math.pow(1.5, reconnectAttempts), 30000)`
- Better timer management with `reconnectTimer` and `pingInterval`
- Enhanced error handling for connection failures

### 3. Fixed api.js - Better URL Detection
**File:** `src/config/api.js`
- Improved URL detection for production WSS
- Added support for both localhost and 127.0.0.1 in development
- Better protocol detection for HTTPS/WSS vs HTTP/WS

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
export const getWsUrl = () => {
  // For development
  if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1') {
    return 'ws://localhost:3000'
  }
  
  // For production - always use WSS when on HTTPS
  if (window.location.protocol === 'https:') {
    return `wss://${window.location.hostname}`
  }
  
  // Fallback to WS
  return `ws://${window.location.hostname}`
}
```

### 4. SSL Certificate Generation Script
**File:** `scripts/generate-ssl-certificates.sh`
- Created script to generate self-signed SSL certificates
- Proper directory creation and permissions
- Ready-to-use for production deployment

## Server-Side WebSocket Handler
**File:** `server/handlers/websocket.js`
- Already had ping/pong support implemented
- No changes needed - handles ping messages correctly

## Deployment Configuration
- NODE_ENV is already set to 'production' in deployment scripts
- SSL certificates will be automatically detected if present
- Server will run on port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS/WSS) in production

## How It Works

### Development Mode
- HTTP server on port 3000
- WebSocket on `ws://localhost:3000`
- No SSL certificates required

### Production Mode
- HTTP server on port 80
- HTTPS server on port 443 (if SSL certificates exist)
- WebSocket on `ws://flipnosis.fun` (HTTP) or `wss://flipnosis.fun` (HTTPS)
- Automatic protocol detection based on page protocol

### Connection Flow
1. Client detects page protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS)
2. Connects to appropriate WebSocket URL (WS vs WSS)
3. Server handles both HTTP and HTTPS connections
4. Ping-pong keepalive prevents disconnections
5. Exponential backoff handles temporary network issues

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Generate SSL Certificates** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/generate-ssl-certificates.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy the Changes**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/deploy-hetzner-git-fixed.ps1 "WebSocket WSS fixes"
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/check-hetzner-status-fixed.ps1 -ServerIP 159.69.242.154
   ```

## Expected Results
- ✅ WebSocket connections will work on both HTTP and HTTPS
- ✅ No more WSS connection failures
- ✅ Stable connections with ping-pong keepalive
- ✅ Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

## Testing
- Test on `https://flipnosis.fun` - should use WSS
- Test on `http://flipnosis.fun` - should use WS
- Monitor browser console for connection logs
- Check server logs for WebSocket activity

## Files Modified
1. `server/server.js` - Server startup and WSS support
2. `src/services/WebSocketService.js` - Connection handling improvements
3. `src/config/api.js` - URL detection improvements
4. `scripts/generate-ssl-certificates.sh` - New SSL certificate script
5. `WEBSOCKET_WSS_FIXES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

All changes implemented exactly as prescribed by Claude Opus.
