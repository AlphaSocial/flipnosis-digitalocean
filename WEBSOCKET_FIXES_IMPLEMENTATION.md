# WebSocket and SSL Fixes Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Claude's prescribed fixes for the WebSocket connection issues in the Flipnosis NFT flipping game.

## Issues Identified
1. **WebSocket SSL/TLS connection failing** - Connections to `wss://flipnosis.fun/ws` were failing with error code 1006
2. **Self-signed certificate issue** - Server was using self-signed certificates that browsers don't trust by default
3. **Input fields disabled** - Both chat and offers inputs were disabled when WebSocket wasn't connected
4. **Poor reconnection logic** - Limited reconnection attempts and no message queuing

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Updated server.js with proper SSL/WebSocket configuration
**File:** `server/server.js`

**Key Changes:**
- Added HTTP/HTTPS detection with fallback
- Improved WebSocket server configuration with proper SSL handling
- Added graceful shutdown handling
- Enhanced timeout checker with better error handling
- Added proper WebSocket verification for self-signed certificates

**Features:**
- Automatic detection of SSL certificates
- Fallback to HTTP if SSL certificates not found
- Better WebSocket server configuration with `perMessageDeflate: false`
- Improved error handling and logging

### Fix 2: Created nginx proxy configuration
**File:** `nginx-fixed.conf`

**Key Features:**
- Proper WebSocket proxy setup with `/ws` location
- SSL configuration with Let's Encrypt support
- Increased timeouts for WebSocket connections (86400s)
- Proper headers for WebSocket upgrade
- Security headers and gzip compression
- Separate handling for API routes and static files

**WebSocket-specific configuration:**
```nginx
location /ws {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_cache off;
    proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
}
```

### Fix 3: Created SSL setup script
**File:** `ssl-setup.sh`

**Features:**
- Automated Let's Encrypt certificate installation
- Fallback to self-signed certificates if Let's Encrypt fails
- Auto-renewal configuration
- Nginx configuration testing and reloading
- Complete SSL setup automation

### Fix 4: Updated WebSocketService.js with better connection handling
**File:** `src/services/WebSocketService.js`

**Key Improvements:**
- **Increased reconnection attempts**: From 5 to 10 attempts
- **Faster initial reconnection**: Reduced delay from 3000ms to 2000ms
- **Message queuing**: Messages are queued when disconnected and sent when reconnected
- **Better heartbeat mechanism**: 15-second intervals with 30-second timeout detection
- **Exponential backoff**: Smart reconnection delays that increase over time
- **Connection state management**: Better tracking of connection states
- **Error handling**: Improved error handling with automatic reconnection
- **Message flushing**: Queued messages are automatically sent when connection is restored

**New Methods:**
- `flushMessageQueue()` - Sends all queued messages when reconnected
- `sendChatMessage()` - Dedicated method for chat messages
- `sendCryptoOffer()` - Dedicated method for crypto offers

### Fix 5: Updated ChatContainer.jsx to enable inputs when disconnected
**File:** `src/components/GamePage/ChatContainer.jsx`

**Key Changes:**
- **Input never disabled**: `disabled={false}` instead of `disabled={!connected}`
- **Visual feedback**: Button changes from "Send" to "Queue" when disconnected
- **Message queuing**: Messages are added to local state and queued for sending
- **Better error handling**: Automatic reconnection attempts
- **Improved UX**: Users can type even when disconnected

**Features:**
- Dynamic placeholder text based on connection status
- Button styling changes based on connection state
- Local message display for immediate feedback
- Automatic reconnection when sending fails

### Fix 6: Updated OffersContainer.jsx to enable inputs when disconnected
**File:** `src/components/GamePage/OffersContainer.jsx`

**Key Changes:**
- **Input never disabled**: `disabled={false}` instead of `disabled={!connected}`
- **Visual feedback**: Button changes from "Make Offer" to "Queue Offer" when disconnected
- **Offer queuing**: Offers are queued and sent when connection is restored
- **Optimistic updates**: Offers appear in the list immediately
- **Better validation**: Improved offer amount validation

**Features:**
- Dynamic button text based on connection status
- Visual border color changes based on connection state
- Local offer display for immediate feedback
- Automatic reconnection when sending fails

## Deployment Script
**File:** `deployment/deploy-websocket-fixes.ps1`

**Features:**
- Automated deployment of all fixes
- Nginx configuration generation
- SSL setup script creation
- Build and deployment automation
- Clear next steps instructions

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes, you should see:

1. **WebSocket connections working properly** with proper SSL certificates
2. **Input fields remain functional** even during temporary disconnections
3. **Messages and offers are queued** when disconnected and sent when reconnected
4. **Better user experience** with visual feedback about connection status
5. **Automatic reconnection** with exponential backoff
6. **Proper SSL setup** with Let's Encrypt certificates

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fixes:**
   ```powershell
   .\deployment\deploy-websocket-fixes.ps1
   ```

2. **Set up SSL certificates on the server:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x ssl-setup.sh && ./ssl-setup.sh
   ```

3. **Configure nginx:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp nginx-flipnosis.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/flipnosis
   sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

4. **Restart the Node.js server:**
   ```bash
   pm2 restart all
   ```

5. **Test the WebSocket connection** in your browser console

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Connection Flow
1. Client attempts to connect to `wss://flipnosis.fun/ws`
2. Nginx proxies the connection to `http://localhost:3001`
3. Node.js server handles the WebSocket upgrade
4. Connection is established with proper SSL termination

### Message Queuing
1. When disconnected, messages are stored in `messageQueue` array
2. When connection is restored, `flushMessageQueue()` sends all queued messages
3. Users see immediate feedback with local message display
4. Messages are sent in the order they were queued

### Reconnection Logic
1. Initial reconnection attempt after 2 seconds
2. Exponential backoff with 1.5x multiplier
3. Maximum delay of 30 seconds
4. Up to 10 reconnection attempts
5. Automatic heartbeat monitoring

This implementation follows Claude's exact prescription and should resolve all the WebSocket connection issues you were experiencing.
