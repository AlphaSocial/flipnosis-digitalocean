- Visual distinction between chat and offer messages
- Accept/reject buttons directly in offer messages
- NFT preview with image and collection info

### ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Design**

## Component Structure

### `UnifiedGameChat.jsx`
The main component that handles both chat and offers functionality.

**Props:**
- `gameId`: Current game identifier
- `gameData`: Game information
- `isCreator`: Boolean indicating if user is game creator
- `socket`: WebSocket connection
- `connected`: Connection status
- `offeredNFTs`: Array of current offers
- `onOfferSubmitted`: Callback for offer submission
- `onOfferAccepted`: Callback for offer acceptance

**Key Features:**
- **Input Mode Toggle**: Switch between chat and offer creation
- **NFT Selector Modal**: Browse and select NFTs to offer
- **Real-time Updates**: Listen for chat messages and offer events
- **Player Name Management**: Set and display player names

### Message Types

1. **Chat Messages** (`type: 'chat'`)
   - Standard text messages
   - User-friendly display names
   - Timestamps

2. **NFT Offers** (`type: 'offer'`)
   - NFT preview with image and details
   - Accept/reject buttons for creators
   - Offer status tracking

3. **Offer Responses** (`type: 'offer_accepted'` / `type: 'offer_rejected'`)
   - Status updates for offer actions
   - Visual feedback for outcomes

## WebSocket Integration

The component listens for these WebSocket events:

```javascript
// Chat messages
{
  type: 'chat_message',
  roomId: gameId,
  message: 'Hello!',
  from: address,
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T12:00:00Z'
}

// NFT offers
{
  type: 'nft_offer',
  gameId: gameId,
  offererAddress: address,
  nft: { /* NFT details */ },
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T12:00:00Z'
}

// Offer acceptance
{
  type: 'accept_nft_offer',
  gameId: gameId,
  creatorAddress: address,
  acceptedOffer: { /* offer details */ },
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T12:00:00Z'
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### For Non-Creators:
- **Mode Toggle**: Easy switching between chat and offer creation

- **Contextual Input**: Input changes based on selected mode

### For Creators:

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- `selectedNFT`: Currently selected NFT for offering
- `playerNames`: Cache of player display names

### Performance Optimizations
- Message virtualization for large chat histories

5. **Real-time Updates**: All interactions update immediately

## Future Enhancements

## Migration Notes

The old separate `GameChatBox` and `NFTOfferComponent` have been replaced with the unified interface. All existing functionality is preserved while providing an improved user experience.

The game page layout has been updated from a 3-column grid to a 2-column grid, providing more space for the unified chat interface while maintaining the game information panel.
