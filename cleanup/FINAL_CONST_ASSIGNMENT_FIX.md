# Final Const Assignment Fix Summary

## Issue
The game page was failing to load with the error:
```
Error loading game data: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## Root Cause
Multiple `const` variables were being reassigned in the minified code, causing runtime errors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `offersData` assignments
**File**: `src/components/UnifiedGamePage.jsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Changed `const offersData = await response.json()` to `let offersData = await response.json()`
- Applied to multiple locations where offers data was being loaded

**Before**:
```javascript
const offersData = await response.json()
```

**After**:
```javascript
let offersData = await response.json()
```

### 2. Fixed `data` assignment in WebSocket message handler
**File**: `src/components/UnifiedGamePage.jsx`

**Location**: Line 564 in `ws.onmessage` handler

**Before**:
```javascript
const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
```

**After**:
```javascript
let data = JSON.parse(event.data)
```

### 3. Fixed `parsedData` assignment in mock WebSocket
**File**: `src/components/UnifiedGamePage.jsx`

**Location**: Line 604 in `createMockWebSocket` function

**Before**:
```javascript
const parsedData = JSON.parse(data)
```

**After**:
```javascript
let parsedData = JSON.parse(data)
```

### 4. Fixed `data` assignment in ETH calculation
**File**: `src/components/UnifiedGamePage.jsx`

**Location**: Line 480 in `calculateAndSetEthAmount` function

**Before**:
```javascript
const data = await response.json()
```

**After**:
```javascript
let data = await response.json()
```

## Why This Happened
When JavaScript code is minified, variable names are shortened to single letters (like `a`, `b`, `c`). If a `const` variable is reassigned anywhere in the code, it causes a runtime error. By changing these to `let`, we allow the variables to be reassigned if needed.

## Expected Result
- ✅ Game pages should now load without const assignment errors
- ✅ WebSocket connections should work properly
- ✅ NFT loading should work on-demand (no spam)
- ✅ ETH calculation should work using Alchemy API

## Testing
1. **Player 1**: Should be able to create games without errors
2. **Player 2**: Should be able to join games without const assignment errors
3. **NFT Loading**: Should only happen when "Load My NFTs" button is clicked
4. **WebSocket**: Should connect and handle messages properly

## Files Modified
- `src/components/UnifiedGamePage.jsx` - Fixed all const assignment issues
- `src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx` - Disabled automatic NFT loading
- `src/components/NFTSelector.jsx` - Added manual NFT loading button

## Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

The const assignment errors should now be completely resolved, and the game should load properly for both players.
