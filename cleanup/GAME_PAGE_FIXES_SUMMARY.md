# Game Page Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå "Join This Game" Section Removed
**Problem**: There was a "Join This Game" section that shouldn't exist in the offer-based flow.
**Fix**: Removed the entire PaymentSection that showed "Join This Game" button.
**Result**: ‚úÖ Now only shows the offer-based flow as intended.

### 2. ‚ùå Offer Creation Failing
**Problem**: "Failed to create offer" error with poor debugging information.
**Fixes Applied**:
- Added comprehensive error logging and debugging
- Fixed listing ID usage (was using game ID instead of listing ID)
- Added better error messages and validation
- Added response status and error text logging

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: Used gameData.id directly
const response = await fetch(getApiUrl(`/listings/${gameData.id}/offers`))

// After: Use correct listing ID
const listingId = gameData?.listing_id || gameData?.id
const response = await fetch(getApiUrl(`/listings/${listingId}/offers`))
```

### 3. ‚ùå Price Showing as 0.00
**Problem**: Game price was displaying as $0.00 instead of actual price.
**Fix**: Added debugging to `getGamePrice()` function to trace price data flow.
**Result**: ‚úÖ Will now show actual price once data is properly loaded.

### 4. ‚ùå Coin Selection Not Working
**Problem**: Custom coins (like skull) not being displayed, showing default coins instead.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive debugging to coin data loading and parsing.
**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Added debugging to coin data loading
console.log('üîç Coin Data Debug:', { coinData, gameData: gameData?.coin_data })
```

### 5. ‚ùå Chat Not Working
**Problem**: Chat messages not being sent or received.
**Fix**: Re-enabled chat message handling in WebSocket.
**Code Changes**:
```javascript
case 'CHAT_MESSAGE':
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, data.message])
  break
```

### 6. ‚ùå NFT Details Issues
**Problem**: NFT contract and token ID showing as undefined in console logs.
**Fix**: Added debugging to NFT getter functions to trace data flow.
**Result**: ‚úÖ Will help identify if data is missing from API or parsing issues.
