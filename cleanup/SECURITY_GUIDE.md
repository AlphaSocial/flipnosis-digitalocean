# Secure Private Key Management

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT

**Your private key has been exposed in your .env file and is now public!**

## Why .env is NOT Safe for Private Keys

1. **Version Control Risks**: Even with .gitignore, accidents happen
2. **Log Files**: Private keys can appear in error logs
3. **Frontend Exposure**: VITE_ variables are bundled into the frontend
4. **Environment Sharing**: Team members might accidentally share .env files
5. **Deployment Exposure**: CI/CD pipelines can expose environment variables

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **SECURE YOUR WALLET IMMEDIATELY**
```bash
# Transfer ALL funds from the exposed wallet to a new secure wallet
# Do this NOW before anyone else can access your funds
```

### 2. **Create a New Secure Wallet**
- Generate a new wallet with a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor)
- Or use a secure software wallet with proper key management
- **NEVER** store private keys in plain text files

### 3. **Remove Private Key from .env**
```bash
# Remove this line from your .env file:
# PRIVATE_KEY=your_exposed_private_key_here
```

### 4. **Use Railway Environment Variables**
Instead of .env, use Railway's secure environment variables:

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to Variables tab
4. Add your private key as a secure environment variable
5. Name it something like `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`

## Secure Private Key Storage Options

### Option 1: Hardware Wallet (RECOMMENDED)
- **Ledger Nano S/X** or **Trezor**
- Private keys never leave the device
- Most secure option for large amounts

### Option 2: Railway Environment Variables
```javascript
// In your server code, access via:
const privateKey = process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Option 3: AWS Secrets Manager
```javascript
// For production applications
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
const secretsManager = new AWS.SecretsManager()

const getSecret = async (secretName) => {
  const data = await secretsManager.getSecretValue({ SecretId: secretName }).promise()
  return JSON.parse(data.SecretString)
}
```

### Option 4: HashiCorp Vault
```javascript
// Enterprise-grade secret management
const vault = require('node-vault')({ apiVersion: 'v1' })
const secret = await vault.read('secret/wallet-key')
```

## Best Practices for Private Key Security

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Store private keys in secure environment variables
- Use multi-signature wallets for team projects
- Regularly rotate keys
- Use different wallets for different purposes
- Backup seed phrases securely (offline, multiple locations)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Store private keys in .env files
- Commit private keys to version control
- Share private keys via email/messaging
- Use the same wallet for development and production
- Store private keys in browser localStorage
- Use private keys in frontend code

## Emergency Recovery Steps

If your wallet has been compromised:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** transfer all funds to a new secure wallet
2. **Document the incident** with timestamps and details
3. **Check transaction history** for unauthorized transfers
4. **Report to relevant authorities** if significant funds were stolen
5. **Review your security practices** and implement improvements

## Environment Variable Security

### For Development:
```bash
# .env.local (gitignored)
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_key_here
```

### For Production (Railway):
```bash
# Set in Railway dashboard
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_key_here
```

### For CI/CD:
```bash
# Use GitHub Secrets or similar
# Never expose in build logs
```

## Code Example: Secure Key Access

```javascript
// server.js
const privateKey = process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY

if (!privateKey) {
  throw new Error('WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable is required')
}

// Validate private key format
if (!/^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{64}$/.test(privateKey)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid private key format')
}

// Use the private key securely
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider)
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

Set up monitoring for:
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Environment variable changes
- Unauthorized access to your deployment

## Regular Security Audits

1. **Monthly**: Review access logs and transaction history
2. **Quarterly**: Audit environment variables and secrets
3. **Annually**: Full security review and penetration testing

## Contact Information

If you need help securing your wallet:
- **Emergency**: Contact your wallet provider immediately
- **Technical Support**: Reach out to your development team
- **Security Experts**: Consider hiring a blockchain security consultant

**Remember: Once a private key is exposed, it's compromised forever. Always prioritize security over convenience.**
