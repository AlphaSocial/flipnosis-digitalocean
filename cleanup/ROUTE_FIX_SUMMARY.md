# Route Navigation Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The "Game not found" error occurred because listings were being incorrectly routed to the games API instead of the listings API.

### **Root Cause**
In `CreateFlip.jsx`, after creating a listing, the navigation was:
```javascript
navigate(`/flip-environment/${listingResult.listingId}`)
```

This caused the listing ID to be passed as the `id` parameter to `FlipEnvironment.jsx`, which has this logic:
```javascript
const isGame = !!id
const currentId = id || listingId
```

Since `id` was the listing ID, `isGame` became `true`, causing the component to try to fetch from `/api/games/listing_...` instead of `/api/listings/listing_...`.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **Fixed Navigation Route**
Changed the navigation in `CreateFlip.jsx` from:
```javascript
navigate(`/flip-environment/${listingResult.listingId}`)
```

To:
```javascript
navigate(`/flip/${listingResult.listingId}`)
```

### **Route Structure**
- `/flip/:listingId` → For listings (correct)
- `/flip-environment/:id` → For games that need environment setup
- `/game/:gameId` → For active games

## ✅ **Expected Result**

After this fix:
1. **Player 1** creates a listing → Navigates to `/flip/listing_...` ✅
2. **Player 2** clicks on listing → Fetches from `/api/listings/listing_...` ✅
3. **Player 2** makes offer → Works correctly ✅
4. **Player 1** accepts offer → Creates game with existing blockchain game ✅
5. **Player 2** loads crypto → Uses existing `contract_game_id` ✅

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Create a new listing
- [ ] Verify navigation goes to `/flip/listing_...`
- [ ] Verify listing loads correctly (no 404 errors)
- [ ] Make an offer as Player 2
- [ ] Accept offer as Player 1
- [ ] Verify Player 2 can load crypto successfully
- [ ] Verify game starts correctly
