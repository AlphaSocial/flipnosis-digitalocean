# Debug Guide: "Invalid Game Configuration" Error

## üö® Problem Description

When Player 2 tries to click "Load Crypto" in the AssetLoadingModal, they get the error:
**"Invalid game configuration. Please refresh and try again."**

This happens because `contract_game_id` is missing or null in the game data.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurs in the **offer acceptance flow**:

1. **Player 1** creates a listing (no blockchain game created yet)
2. **Player 2** makes an offer on the listing  
3. **Player 1** accepts the offer ‚Üí creates a database game record with `contract_game_id = null`
4. **Player 2** tries to load crypto ‚Üí gets "invalid game configuration" because `contract_game_id` is null

## üîß Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Database for Games Missing contract_game_id

Run the debugging script:
```bash
node scripts/fixMissingContractGameId.js
```

This will show you:
- How many games are missing `contract_game_id`
- Which games are affected
- When they were created
- Recommended actions

### Step 2: Check Game Consistency

Run the consistency checker:
```bash
node scripts/checkGameConsistency.js
```

**IMPORTANT**: Update the script with your actual contract address and RPC URL first!

This will show you:
- Games missing `contract_game_id` in database
- Games where on-chain game doesn't exist
- Games with inconsistent data between DB and blockchain

### Step 3: Check Offer Flow

Run the offer flow debugger:
```bash
node scripts/debugOfferFlow.js
```

This will show you:
- Recent offers and their status
- Games created from offers
- Whether `contract_game_id` is being set correctly

## üîß Solutions

### Immediate Fix: Clean Up Database

For recent games (< 1 hour old) that are missing `contract_game_id`:

```sql
-- Delete recent games missing contract_game_id
DELETE FROM games WHERE contract_game_id IS NULL AND created_at > datetime('now', '-1 hour');
```

For old games (> 1 hour old):

```sql
-- Mark old games as cancelled
UPDATE games SET status = 'cancelled' WHERE contract_game_id IS NULL AND created_at <= datetime('now', '-1 hour');
```

### Long-term Fix: Update Offer Acceptance Flow

The real fix is to ensure that when an offer is accepted, the blockchain game is created immediately. This requires updating the offer acceptance endpoint in `server/server.js`.

## üìä Debug Logging Added

I've added comprehensive debug logging to track the issue:

### Frontend Logging (CreateFlip.jsx)
- Logs blockchain game creation parameters
- Logs the returned `gameId` from contract
- Logs database save attempts
- Logs navigation to game

### Backend Logging (server.js)
- Logs received game creation requests
- Logs database insert operations
- Logs offer acceptance flow
- Logs when games are created with null `contract_game_id`

### AssetLoadingModal Logging
- Logs when `handleLoadCrypto` is called
- Logs the game data being used
- Logs when `contract_game_id` is missing
- Logs join game attempts

## üéØ Expected Flow (Correct)

1. **Player 1** creates a listing
2. **Player 2** makes an offer
3. **Player 1** accepts offer ‚Üí **BLOCKCHAIN GAME CREATED IMMEDIATELY**
4. **Database updated** with `contract_game_id`
5. **Player 2** can load crypto using the `contract_game_id`

## üö® Current Flow (Broken)

1. **Player 1** creates a listing
2. **Player 2** makes an offer  
3. **Player 1** accepts offer ‚Üí **ONLY DATABASE GAME CREATED** (no blockchain)
4. **Database game** has `contract_game_id = null`
5. **Player 2** tries to load crypto ‚Üí **ERROR: "Invalid game configuration"**

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Run the debug scripts** to identify affected games
2. **Clean up the database** using the SQL commands above
3. **Fix the offer acceptance flow** to create blockchain games immediately
4. **Test the flow** to ensure it works correctly

## üìù Notes

- The `contract_game_id` is the crucial link between database games and on-chain games
- When missing, Player 2 cannot join the blockchain game
- The AssetLoadingModal correctly detects this and shows the error
- The fix requires updating the server-side offer acceptance logic
