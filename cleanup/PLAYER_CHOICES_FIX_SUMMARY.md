# PlayerChoices Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing a `ReferenceError: playerChoices is not defined` error when Player 2 tried to join a game. This error occurred in the `useGameData` hook when handling WebSocket messages.

## Root Cause
After the WebSocket refactoring, the `playerChoices` state variable was no longer accessible within the `handleWebSocketMessage` function in `useGameData`. The function was trying to access `playerChoices.creator` and `playerChoices.joiner` but `playerChoices` was not passed as a parameter to the hook.

## Solution
1. **Modified `useGameData` hook signature** in `src/components/GamePage/hooks/useGameData.js`:
   - Added `playerChoices` as the last parameter to the hook
   - This makes `playerChoices` available within the `handleWebSocketMessage` function

2. **Updated `useGameState` hook** in `src/components/GamePage/hooks/useGameState.js`:
   - Modified the call to `useGameData` to pass `playerChoices` as the last argument
   - This ensures the `playerChoices` state is properly passed down to the WebSocket message handler

## Files Modified
- `src/components/GamePage/hooks/useGameData.js` - Added `playerChoices` parameter
- `src/components/GamePage/hooks/useGameState.js` - Updated `useGameData` call to pass `playerChoices`

## Testing
- Created and ran a test script (`scripts/testPlayerChoicesFix.js`) that verifies the application loads without the `playerChoices is not defined` error
- Test passed successfully ✅

## Impact
- Fixes the immediate error that was preventing Player 2 from joining games
- Maintains the WebSocket refactoring benefits (centralized connection management, automatic reconnection, etc.)
- Ensures proper state synchronization between players during the game

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The `playerChoices is not defined` error has been fixed and the application now loads without critical JavaScript errors.
